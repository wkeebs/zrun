- Strava integration

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Type-safe API integration

### Backend

- Spring Boot (Java 17)
- MongoDB for flexible data storage
- Spring Security for authentication
- RESTful API design

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
- Java 17 (JDK)
- Maven
- Git

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd zrun
```

2. Start the development environment:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:

- MongoDB on port 27017
- Spring Boot backend on port 8080
- Next.js frontend on port 3000

### Development Workflow

The development environment is configured for hot-reloading:

- Frontend changes will automatically refresh
- Backend changes will trigger a Spring Boot restart
- Database data persists between restarts
